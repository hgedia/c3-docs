# algebra

Crypto3.Algebra library provides a set algebraic constructions being used mostly for public-key schemes. The following are the building blocks for the module. Please see below for how to use the API's.

* [Curves](manual/curves.md) - Elliptic curve base classes
* [Fields](implementation/field.md) -  Field elements for elliptic curves with overloaded field arithmetic operations.
* [Pairings](manual/pairings.md) - Bi-linear parings for efficient computation
* [Matrix](manual/matrix.md) - Compile time matrix operations on vectors/scalars
* [Multi-Exponentiation](manual/multi-exponentiation.md) - Multi-exponentiation algorithms for field elements
